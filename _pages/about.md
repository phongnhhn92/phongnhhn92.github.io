I am a PhD student at [Center for Machine Vision and Signal Analysis](https://www.oulu.fi/cmvs/), [University of Oulu, Finland](https://www.oulu.fi/university/), where I am co-advised by [Prof. Janne Heikkil√§](https://www.oulu.fi/university/researcher/janne-heikkila) and [Prof. Esa Rahtu](https://esa.rahtu.fi/). My work is funded by the Infotech Oulu.

I'm interested in the topic of 3D reconstruction, novel view synthesis and neural rendering. My research combines 3D computer vision and deep learning.

I am also curious about effective learning and teaching techniques.
