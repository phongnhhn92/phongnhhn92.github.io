I am a PhD student at [Center for Machine Vision and Signal Analysis](https://www.oulu.fi/cmvs/), [University of Oulu, Finland](https://www.oulu.fi/university/), where I am co-advised by [Prof. Janne Heikkilä](https://www.oulu.fi/university/researcher/janne-heikkila) and [Prof. Esa Rahtu](https://esa.rahtu.fi/). My work is funded by the Infotech Oulu.

I'm interested in the topic of 3D reconstruction, novel view synthesis and neural rendering. My research combines 3D computer vision and deep learning.

My hobby is travelling and singing ^^
