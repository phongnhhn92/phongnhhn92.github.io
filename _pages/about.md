<div style='text-align: justify;'>

I am a PhD student at [Center for Machine Vision and Signal Analysis](https://www.oulu.fi/cmvs/), [University of Oulu, Finland](https://www.oulu.fi/university/), where I am co-advised by [Prof. Janne Heikkil√§](https://www.oulu.fi/university/researcher/janne-heikkila) and [Prof. Esa Rahtu](https://esa.rahtu.fi/). My work is funded by the Infotech Oulu.


I'm interested in the topic of 3D reconstruction, novel view synthesis and neural rendering. My research combines 3D computer vision and deep learning.

Feel me to reach me through email if you want to discuss more about above research topics or job opportunities.
